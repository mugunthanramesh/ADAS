## Parking Assistant System using Deep Learning

Due to the increase in population, the usage of automated vehicles and self driving cars is mandatory. Therefore development of Parking Assistant System is the need of the hour. In this Project, a parking assistance is developed where obstacles are detected with the help of the camera using Deep neural network algorithm (YOLO) and the distance between the obstacle and vehicle is calculated using Ultrasonic sensor. The data from the camera and Ultrasonic sensor is mapped into a single 2D coordinate by Data fusion technique. This is displayed in the dashboard of the vehicle for the referece of the driver. This Mapping is updated simultaneously. This project help the driver for the movement of the vehicle in the dense areas. This helps in cozy parking of the vehicle by the driver. The future development of this project is instead of displaying the obstacle in the dashboard, the vehicle can be made autonomous from the data obtained from Data fusion.
